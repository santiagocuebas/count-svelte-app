# Count App

Hello! This is an application developed with Svelte, an interactive click counter that increments the counter when you click a button. The counter is reset if the reset button is clicked.

This application was created for the Aprende React Desde Cero course published on the YouTube channel [freeCodeCamp Espa√±ol](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecampespanol). Its initial structure was created with the command `npm create svelte@latest .`.

## Run the Application
To start the application, you must run the `npm run dev` command in the terminal.

The application will automatically open in the default browser configured on your device and will run on `localhost:3000`.

## Install Modules
To install the necessary modules for the application, you must run the `pnpm install` command in the terminal.
